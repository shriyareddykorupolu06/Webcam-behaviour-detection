# Webcam-behaviour-detection
## Overview
This project uses webcam to detect faces and track human expression. Currently, it detects whether a person is present and show a basic expression status. Implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, it runs directly in a browser via Live Server.
## Features
Detects face using the webcam

4. View face detection and activity status in real time
## Notes
Modern browsers require explicit camera permission
Windows Camera settings must allow apps and desktop access
No external dataset is needed
Implementation and testing done by me with AI assistance.
## Future Improvements
Real-time emotion detection using TensorFlow.js
Attention or drowsiness tracking
Logging activity/emotion history over time
